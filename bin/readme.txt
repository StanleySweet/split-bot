Split Bot v1.0.0alpha2 

== development state ==

The bot builds strong soldiers, and attacks in waves of 30 to 40 soldiers. 

The defense is still hazardous since there is no Defense Agent yet and it does not detect that it is under attack, but it builds defense towers and keeps men for defense.

== Use ==

Paste SplitBot.js and data.json to 0 A.D./binaries/data/mods/public/simulation/ai/splitbot/

And choose "AI - Split Bot" as the AI of your oponent
